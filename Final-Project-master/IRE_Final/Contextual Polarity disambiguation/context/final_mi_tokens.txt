FLYING out to HOU Monday for the Jets-Texans Pre season MNF game !
" CANT WAIT "
#FLIGHTBOYS
Woot !
So
excited that
I get to watch tonight's game . Go Colts !!
@someUSER Verlander is possibly ahead of CC , more SOs
better
ERA , but CC will bounce back after last night's outing like he
always
does
RT @someUSER : @someUSER
great
to meet the guys from Blue today at Nurburgring . A very
cool
bunch of guys ! Looking forward to hear ...
The takeaway from tonight's game : the Colts ' run defense was
HUGE .
And Curtis Painter rightfully owes us all ( us especially ) a
big finger .
Lucy Hale is trending
worldwide !
The girls from #PrettyLittleLiars are getting
some love
from the fans tonight . Congrats , @someUSER !

@someUSER even if the Steelers win I'd be

Kerry Collins may look like an old mouse ... and hold on to the ball like one ... but is a Curtis Painter experiment REALLY
that much better ?
They figure they
better
get it all in tonight cause of Verlander tomorrow ? Is that it ? #Indians

Going to predict that Curtis Painter
" gets it "
this season , throws for 24TD and 3400 yards . #Colts trade him for a 2nd round pick . #sarcasm
Watch Monday Night Football tonight (& pre-game festivities ) on ESPN . I'm in the intro with Hank Williams Jr. Starts at 6pm EST . I will ..
@someUSER that could be
the turning point
in the series . Not
just the game ...... the
series . With Verlander pitching Thursday .....
spot price on 14KT gold is $49.08 dwt in Tampa Bay today - crazy that gold is over $1800/ounce - remember when the real price was $300.00 ..
#NFL and #ESPN have as many kinks to work out as the teams -- they just flashed the " Monday Night Football " graphic ...

If ESPN has a Hank Williams " Are You Ready For Some Football ? " song for tonight , I might pass out with
happiness .
Think I
might
go to the Colts game tomorrow
Bucs play pats tonight let's go Tampa bay !
@someUSER Well , he's 2nd in the AL in ERA . He has a
chance
at the Cy Young , though Verlander is probably ahead of him right now
In 14 minutes of Kerry Collins , the #Colts are down 17 . Let's give Curtis Painter a shot in the 2nd quarter . Why not ?
@someUSER Must . Get . Innings . We must pile on
and decimate
